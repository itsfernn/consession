## üöÄ Features

- **List and attach** to open tmux sessions using fzf for fuzzy searching.
- **Create new sessions** automatically from your frequently used directories (via zoxide).
- **Interactive preview** of session output and directory contents.
- **Keybindings** for renaming and killing sessions directly from the fzf interface.
- **Customizable** appearance and behavior through configuration variables.
